      <td>Provincial police in Norfolk County are investigating after six puppies were found dead with their hind legs tied together. A woman who was walking her own dog at a fenced-in, abandoned property along Hume Street in Simcoe, Ont.  stumbled across what the OPP described as the "gruesome discovery" on Thursday, said Const. Sanchuk said the puppies are in an "advanced state of decomposition" so it's difficult to tell what breed they are, but they appear to be newborns and it's clear their rear legs are tied together with rope or twine. "Anyone with information that may know someone that recently had a litter of puppies, maybe five or six of them and they don't know what happened to those puppies … is being urged to contact Crime Stoppers and the Norfolk County OPP," he said.</td>

      <td>UPDATED: Fri. , April 5, 2019 SpokAnimal, an adoption agency now caring for five puppies adopted during a weekend pet expo that were diagnosed this week with the contagious, sometimes deadly canine parvovirus, has closed its dog kennel for quarantine. “We are cleaning and deep cleaning. ” Peck said Friday the kennel will be closed for at least 10 days. That means all dog transfers will go on hold, Peck said, including shipments from regional and out-of-state shelters. The puppies, heeler mixes, all came from the same litter brought in by a local man, said Peck. The incubation period for parvovirus typically stretches up to two weeks, according to Lindsey Soffes, regional director of SCRAPS, and puppies are most susceptible because their immune systems aren’t fully developed and  don’t yet have all the proper vaccinations. Peck said Friday there’s no evidence to suggest the virus spread beyond the five original puppies.</td>

      <td>Animal Care Services cruelty investigators in Texas are seeking more information concerning two unrelated cases where dog owners sliced off part of the ears of pit bull puppies instead of taking the dogs to a licensed veterinarian for the surgical procedure. A resident called ACS about the first case that took place on March 14 in the backyard of a San Antonio home. The second case took place in the living room of a West Side home around March 24. ACS officers were able to verify the second case after pictures of the bloodied puppy “Sancho” were posted on a Facebook page by the owner. “I hope that other people get away from playing doctor and leave animal surgeries to the veterinarians. ” ACS assistant director Shannon Sims said the practice of cropping ears is not illegal but it is unlawful in Texas for non-licensed veterinarians to perform the operation.</td>

      <td>Aimee Goodwin snuggles with one of the rescue puppies she helped bring to Vermont from Puerto Rico at her home in Norwich, Friday, Nov.  17, 2017. WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — A Norwich woman who started rescuing stray dogs from Puerto Rico three years ago has her eyes set on her next venture: an adoption, volunteer and education center in downtown White River Junction. Aimee Goodwin has plans to open Puppy Junction next month, a storefront that will give the nonprofit Student Rescue Project a place to showcase rescued dogs that are up for adoption in the Upper Valley. For the past three years, the rescued dogs go into foster homes after arriving in the Upper Valley while the adoption process is carried out. “Every time we place a dog in a home it brings in the funds and opens up availability to get another dog off the street,” said Goodwin, who also owns Canine Mountain Adventures, a dog walking and socialization business in Norwich.</td>

      <td>No one was home when firefighters arrived at the scene Friday. Firefighters rescued a dog and three puppies from a Burlington house where smoke was reported Friday afternoon. Deputy Burlington Fire Chief Don Ryan said the house at 644 Higbee Ave.  sustained significant smoke and water damage. Ryan said the occupants were not home when the fire was reported at 5:18 p. m.  Friday, but arrived on the scene after firefighters arrived. Additional information was not available, and reports of children being in the home and taken to a neighbor's at around the time the blaze was reported could not be confirmed by Burlington fire or police sources. Burlington Police Sgt.  Eric Short said a summons to the Iowa Department of Human Resources is routine in cases when parents' whereabouts is not known. He said the parents arrived at the scene at about the same time as DHS. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/endangered-wolf-center-studies-why-captive-african-painted-dogs-look-different-wild-ones</td>
      <td>Earlier this year, the Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka had its first litter of African painted dog puppies, giving researchers a chance to compare how they develop in captivity versus the wild. Conservationists have noticed differences in appearances between captive and wild populations, said Regina Mossotti, director of animal care and conservation at the Endangered Wolf Center. “Their leg lengths and facial features are different from the captive to the wild, and we’re researching why that is,” Mossotti said. Scientists suspect that’s because captive and wild dogs have different feeding habits. The center has had African painted dogs since 2003. The staff at the Endangered Wolf Center can tell the puppies apart, since each one has different patterns — like a fingerprint, Mossotti said. The center works with world-renowned painted dog scientist Greg Rasmussen, who has studied the species for more than 30 years.</td>
