      <td>So has the thinking of most Americans — more than 62 percent support legalizing marijuana, according to a Pew Research Center poll in October. On HoustonChronicle. com: Marijuana industry sees a big market in Texas In the 34 states where marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational use, sales totaled $10. 4 billion last year, according to government figures. The potential U. S.  market, if every state legalized pot, is about $150 billion. The legal marijuana business currently employs 250,000 people, according to industry figures. Gov.  Greg Abbott said he would support legislation that reduces possession of small amounts to a Class C Misdemeanor, which would preclude jail time. Forty-six states allow marijuana use for medical purposes, and 10 states have legalized small amounts for adult recreational use. Law enforcement arrested about 66,000 Texans for possession of marijuana in 2017, according to Department of Public Safety figures. Marijuana possession made up 49 percent of all drug arrests that year.</td>

      <td>25 Local Governments Sue to Halt California Cannabis Delivery</td>

      <td>LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a major challenge to regulations that govern California’s marijuana market, Beverly Hills and 24 other local governments sued Friday to overturn a rule allowing home deliveries statewide, even into communities that banned commercial cannabis sales. The League of California Cities and police chiefs had complained that unrestricted home deliveries would create an unruly market of largely hidden cannabis transactions, while undercutting local control guaranteed in the 2016 law that broadly legalized marijuana sales in California and created the nation’s largest legal cannabis marketplace. Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors Chairman Ryan Coonerty said in a statement that the state rule damages local marijuana businesses and “betrays the promise made to the voters” in 2016. The 2016 law said local governments had the authority to ban nonmedical cannabis businesses. But state regulators pointed to the business and professions code, which said local governments “shall not prevent delivery of cannabis or cannabis products on public roads” by a licensed operator.</td>

      <td>The mother of a nine-year-old girl with severe epilepsy wept as she had an illegal supply of medical cannabis confiscated by customs officials after entering the UK with the potentially life-saving medication that her daughter cannot access, despite changes in the law. The law in the UK was changed last November to make access to medical cannabis legal, but parents have been struggling to secure prescriptions, in part due to reluctance within the medical community, with the Royal College of Physicians and the British Paediatric Neurology Association largely discouraging use of the medicine. But everyone involved with the implementation should hang their heads in shame. ” A government spokesman said: “The decision to prescribe cannabis-based products for medicinal use is a clinical decision for specialist hospital doctors, made with patients and their families, taking into account clinical guidance.</td>
