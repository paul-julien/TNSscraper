  'Summary': 'LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a major challenge to regulations that '
             'govern California’s marijuana market, Beverly Hills and 24 other '
             'local governments sued Friday to overturn a rule allowing home '
             'deliveries statewide, even into communities that banned '
             'commercial cannabis sales. The League of California Cities and '
             'police chiefs had complained that unrestricted home deliveries '
             'would create an unruly market of largely hidden cannabis '
             'transactions, while undercutting local control guaranteed in the '
             '2016 law that broadly legalized marijuana sales in California '
             'and created the nation’s largest legal cannabis marketplace. '
             'Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors Chairman Ryan Coonerty '
             'said in a statement that the state rule damages local marijuana '
             'businesses and “betrays the promise made to the voters” in 2016. '
             'The 2016 law said local governments had the authority to ban '
             'nonmedical cannabis businesses. But state regulators pointed to '
             'the business and professions code, which said local governments '
             '“shall not prevent delivery of cannabis or cannabis products on '
             'public roads” by a licensed operator. '}]
