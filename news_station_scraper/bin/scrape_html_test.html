      <td>Going small in your baits works wonders on all species. Going small in your baits works wonders on all species. I have become very fond of very small crank baits which are awesome for crappies and walleye. You don’t need a large bait to catch fish. 1) Small is Beautiful: Many of the lakes I fish here in the northwest part of Minnesota feature some awesome crappies, bluegills and occasional walleye. My favorite mini baits are about 1-inch long and feature basically no lip but rather a flat front. The no lip feature allows the bait to travel horizontally across the top of weed growth, thus eliminating the snags and weed hassles. 2) Flat Retrieve: Working these baits over weed growth is relatively simple as the retrieve is a straight retrieve at a slow pace. The action of the bait and the smallness of the bait allows most any panfish or predator fish to smash it with ease.</td>

      <td>I don’t want to use invasive plants in my landscape. Homeowners should always be concerned about using invasive plants in the landscape. The State of Florida has a list of Noxious Weeds and Invasive Plants that they regulate. The University of Florida has created an assessment tool that looks at the risk of invasion for plants including hybrids, new cultivars and selections. The most likely reason pecan trees do not produce well is because of a disease called pecan scab. The symptoms of Pecan Scab include dark spots on leaves, twigs, and nuts. The list of recommended pecan cultivars for north Florida can be found at: edis. ifas. ufl. edu/pdffiles/HS/HS10600. pdf. I have a green fungus growing on the trunk of my tree. Lichens that grow on tree trunks do not harm the tree in any way. They grow on top of the bark and do not cause tree disease.</td>

      <td>IRON MOUNTAIN — Anglers are landing bluegills and crappies in 12 feet or more of water as panfish action has picked up, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources said. Walleye fishing has also been good, Whisler said, noting “they’ve been getting some nice ones. ” The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said Lake Michigan anglers in the Marinette area were trying for trout and salmon with mixed results. Anglers still were getting a fair number of lake trout along with a few salmon; however, they were putting in a lot of time trying to find them. Little Bay De Noc: The best walleye action was from Breezy Point south to Round Island trolling a crawler harness or stick baits in 14 to 25 feet both early and late. Those after lake trout reported fair to good catches southeast of the buoy in 120 to 180 feet.</td>

      <td>Dear Master Gardener: I saw an insect that looks and flies like a hummingbird. Answer: The insect you most likely saw, and that frequently gets mistaken for a hummingbird, is a moth. Another moth that hovers around flowers like a hummingbird is the white-lined sphinx moth. Like hummingbirds, both moths hover and flit about in flower gardens. To get rid of yellowjacket and paper wasp nests it is best to treat them late in the evening or early in the morning when they are less active. Dear Master Gardener: Why is purple loosestrife a noxious weed?Yes, purple loosestrife is pretty but as Grandma says, “Pretty is as pretty does. ” Dear Readers: The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) has been receiving reports of residents receiving unsolicited packages of seeds appearing to come from China. Create a compost pile with grass clippings, leaves, garden debris (plant material), egg shells, and fruit and vegetable scraps.</td>

      <td>Recently the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries (ADAI) along with state departments of agriculture in states all around the nation have received numerous reports from citizens and home owners who have received unsolicited packages stamped from China which contain seeds. In normal situations ALL seed and plant shipments into the United States would be subject to inspection and quarantine procedures as outlined by the United States Department of Agriculture. Just for example, in 2017 the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service inspected and cleared more than 17,000 shipments containing in excess of 1. 6 BILLION plant units and close to 1. 900 tons of seeds while intercepting 817 quarantined pests including potentially damaging insects, plant diseases, and weeds. It is currently believed that the recent “mystery” seed shipments are an attempt to avoid inspection which is a form of agricultural smuggling and is treated very seriously.</td>

      <td>July through September is the optimal time to begin planting several vegetable varieties in order to have a bountiful fall harvest, said David Hillock, Oklahoma State University Extension horticulture specialist. “A successful fall garden begins in the heat of the summer,” Hillock said. “Some of the best-quality garden vegetables are produced and harvested during the fall season when warm, sunny days are followed by cool, humid nights. Under these climatic conditions, plant soil metabolism is low, which means more of the food manufactured by the plant becomes a high-quality vegetable product. ” Some tender vegetables that can be started in July and August and harvested before fall frosts include beans, cilantro, sweet corn, cucumber, pumpkin, and summer and winter squash. Hillock said achieving a full stand of plants in the heat of summer may require special treatments. “To extend your gardening time even further, consider using cold frames and row covers,” Hillock said.</td>

If you have a little extra time to give back to your community, we can use prep cooks to help Brian (our chef) prepare the meals before we open up. We could use someone to transfer prepared meals from Backus to Pine River. Gardens have been planted to provide fresh produce for these meals. This means we need gardening help to weed and water the plants. Volunteers have been giving out the meals at both sites and helping with clean up after. Gardeners, please consider donating your excess produce to this program to ensure we are providing the healthiest meals for our guests. Please send checks to Pine River-Backus Family Center, PO Box 1, Pine River, MN 56474 with a notation of "Free CommUnity Meals" in the memo section. Kathleen Stephan is a volunteer at the Pine River-Backus Family Center.</td>

      <td>Don't expect to recharge your soil with water by standing in place with hose in hand, directing a shower of water onto your tomato plants. Nighttime also is not a good time to water because the leaves stay wet too long, promoting diseases. The essence of drip irrigation is simply a plastic pipe laid in the garden row, with emitters at intervals out of which water slowly drips. Dripped water is less subject to evaporation and lessens the chance of diseases by not wetting plant leaves. Drip irrigation, by pinpointing water near your garden plants, also results in less weeding. A sprinkler spreads water not only to your garden plants, but also to paths and areas between rows, where it promotes weed growth. One of the best features of drip irrigation is that it makes frequent, shallow watering possible simply by attaching a timer to your hose spigot.</td>
