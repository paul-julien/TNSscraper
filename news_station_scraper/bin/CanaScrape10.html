      <td>So has the thinking of most Americans — more than 62 percent support legalizing marijuana, according to a Pew Research Center poll in October. On HoustonChronicle. com: Marijuana industry sees a big market in Texas In the 34 states where marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational use, sales totaled $10. 4 billion last year, according to government figures. The potential U. S.  market, if every state legalized pot, is about $150 billion. The legal marijuana business currently employs 250,000 people, according to industry figures. Gov.  Greg Abbott said he would support legislation that reduces possession of small amounts to a Class C Misdemeanor, which would preclude jail time. Forty-six states allow marijuana use for medical purposes, and 10 states have legalized small amounts for adult recreational use. Law enforcement arrested about 66,000 Texans for possession of marijuana in 2017, according to Department of Public Safety figures. Marijuana possession made up 49 percent of all drug arrests that year.</td>

      <td>25 Local Governments Sue to Halt California Cannabis Delivery</td>

      <td>LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a major challenge to regulations that govern California’s marijuana market, Beverly Hills and 24 other local governments sued Friday to overturn a rule allowing home deliveries statewide, even into communities that banned commercial cannabis sales. The League of California Cities and police chiefs had complained that unrestricted home deliveries would create an unruly market of largely hidden cannabis transactions, while undercutting local control guaranteed in the 2016 law that broadly legalized marijuana sales in California and created the nation’s largest legal cannabis marketplace. Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors Chairman Ryan Coonerty said in a statement that the state rule damages local marijuana businesses and “betrays the promise made to the voters” in 2016. The 2016 law said local governments had the authority to ban nonmedical cannabis businesses. But state regulators pointed to the business and professions code, which said local governments “shall not prevent delivery of cannabis or cannabis products on public roads” by a licensed operator.</td>

      <td>The mother of a nine-year-old girl with severe epilepsy wept as she had an illegal supply of medical cannabis confiscated by customs officials after entering the UK with the potentially life-saving medication that her daughter cannot access, despite changes in the law. The law in the UK was changed last November to make access to medical cannabis legal, but parents have been struggling to secure prescriptions, in part due to reluctance within the medical community, with the Royal College of Physicians and the British Paediatric Neurology Association largely discouraging use of the medicine. But everyone involved with the implementation should hang their heads in shame. ” A government spokesman said: “The decision to prescribe cannabis-based products for medicinal use is a clinical decision for specialist hospital doctors, made with patients and their families, taking into account clinical guidance.</td>

      <td>The German media is reporting that three Canadian firms have been selected for the cultivation bid, but there is no official confirmation and plenty of looming complications. The Frankfurt-based newspaper Handelsblatt Zeitung is reporting that three Canadian firms (actually two Canadians and a German start-up cofounded by another Canadian company) have now been selected as the first cannabis cultivation bid finalists, however insiders on the ground say that this is not necessarily a final decision. The companies awarded lots received the allocation based on a rigorous application process, not media sensation. ” Of all the Canadian firms, in fact, despite its lack of high-flying stock price, Wayland has made the most concerted effort to show its commitment to producing in Germany by a large investment of capital and expertise. At the same time, it is also clear that producers like Nysk and beyond them, Israeli and Australian firms (in particular) are actively finding ways to have their product enter the country- and further at prices that are catching the Canadians on the hop.</td>

S.  Speaker of the House, John Boehner. As the first nation to legalize medical cannabis over a decade ago, Israel has allowed companies like Tikun Olam, as well as medical, research and educational institutions, to undertake the groundbreaking research that has created the basis for some of the advancements in this fast-growing industry,” said Stephen Gardner, Chief Marketing Officer of Tikun Olam, USA.

Yet an undercover Mail on Sunday reporter going through Facebook forums for parents nursing sick children was able to buy cannabis oils that laboratory tests showed had THC levels far in excess of 80 per cent. Cannabis containing small, carefully controlled amounts of THC has been claimed to help young children with severe epilepsy, including Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley, for whom Home Secretary Sajid Javid has licensed use of the drug after the high-profile campaigns spearheaded by their mothers.</td>

      <td>ALBUQUERQUE, N. M. , April  05, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed Senate Bill 406 into law on Thursday, April 4, effectively overhauling the state’s medical cannabis law for the first time since the inception of the program 12 years ago. The sweeping enhancements to the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act support the New Mexico Legislature’s public policy effort to define the use of medical cannabis as the equivalent of any other medical treatment. Other new additions to the law include guidance for medical cannabis consumption areas, removal of potency caps, continued enrollment via telemedicine, patient eligibility for anatomical gifting, and access to medical cannabis for those who are under supervision or in custody of a state or local government. With the addition of these statutory improvements, total active participants in New Mexico’s Medical Cannabis Program are projected to swell to nearly 150,000 by June 30, 2020.</td>

      <td>However, another cannabinoid in cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), can have positive therapeutic effects and is causing countries around the world to legalise the drug’s use for medical purposes. Despite the country’s leading position, many patients in the UK with signed medical cannabis prescriptions are unable to access the drug. In contrast, importers of medical cannabis in the UK must apply to the Home Office for a license and the process can take up to 28 days, by which time a patient’s prescription may have expired. It is important that decision-makers realise the therapeutic potential that medical cannabis offers and are aware of the currently unmet need in the healthcare industry. Thorough data from randomised clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis is required for the healthcare industry to increase its confidence in the drug and license it for a greater number of patients.</td>

      <td>The legislation would remove a cap limiting the amount of THC in products to 3 percent, replacing it with language permitting Iowans to purchase up to 25 grams in a 90-day period. During debate, Rep.  Jarad Klein, R-Keota, a bill supporter, told the House he had worked on the proposal with members of the state Medical Cannabis Advisory Board. Zadeh insisted Klein misrepresented the position of the board, which voted last fall to recommend keeping the THC cap in place. The nine-member Cannabis Advisory Board, appointed by the governor, is made up of medical practitioners and one law enforcement officer. Other medical practitioners, sick Iowans, caregivers and entrepreneurs who have invested in Iowa’s fledgling program have roundly and reasonably criticized the THC cap as too restrictive. The appointed advisory board made its recommendation, and we hope members continue to lend their expertise to the evolving program.</td>
