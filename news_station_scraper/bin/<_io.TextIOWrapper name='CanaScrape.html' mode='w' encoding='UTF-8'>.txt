  'Summary': 'LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a major challenge to regulations that '
             'govern California’s marijuana market, Beverly Hills and 24 other '
             'local governments sued Friday to overturn a rule allowing home '
             'deliveries statewide, even into communities that banned '
             'commercial cannabis sales. The League of California Cities and '
             'police chiefs had complained that unrestricted home deliveries '
             'would create an unruly market of largely hidden cannabis '
             'transactions, while undercutting local control guaranteed in the '
             '2016 law that broadly legalized marijuana sales in California '
             'and created the nation’s largest legal cannabis marketplace. '
             'Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors Chairman Ryan Coonerty '
             'said in a statement that the state rule damages local marijuana '
             'businesses and “betrays the promise made to the voters” in 2016. '
             'The 2016 law said local governments had the authority to ban '
             'nonmedical cannabis businesses. But state regulators pointed to '
             'the business and professions code, which said local governments '

             'confirmation and plenty of looming complications. The '

             'however insiders on the ground say that this is not necessarily '
             'a final decision. The companies awarded lots received the '
             'allocation based on a rigorous application process, not media '
             'sensation. ” Of all the Canadian firms, in fact, despite its '
             'lack of high-flying stock price, Wayland has made the most '
             'concerted effort to show its commitment to producing in Germany '
             'by a large investment of capital and expertise. At the same '
             'time, it is also clear that producers like Nysk and beyond them, '

             'finding ways to have their product enter the country- and '
             'further at prices that are catching the Canadians on the hop. '},

  'Summary': 'However, another cannabinoid in cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), can '
             'have positive therapeutic effects and is causing countries '
             'around the world to legalise the drug’s use for medical '

             'in the UK with signed medical cannabis prescriptions are unable '
             'to access the drug. In contrast, importers of medical cannabis '
             'in the UK must apply to the Home Office for a license and the '
             'process can take up to 28 days, by which time a patient’s '
             'prescription may have expired. It is important that '
             'decision-makers realise the therapeutic potential that medical '
